# AIG: Assignment 2<br>Reinforcement learning

This assignment focuses on implementing various concepts of reinforcement learning, all the way from environment model to state evaluation to deep reinforcement learning. While technically a team project, each member works on the questions on his own and the whole team ultimately writes a report together.
