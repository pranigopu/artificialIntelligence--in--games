## Some interesting terms
### Benchmark (in computing)
A benchmark in computing is a test used to compare performance between multiple objects/systems (hardware or software), either against each other or against an accepted standard. For example, it could be a framework that offers an environment that enables you to develop, test and compare software modules.

### Instantiation of a class (in object-oriented programming)
Instantiation refers to (unless mentioned otherwise) the instantiation of a class, i.e. the creation of an object that concretizes (_i.e. realizes in execution_) the specifications of a class.

_Note that a class is an encapsulation of attributes and methods (i.e. functions) that represents a programmable unit (i.e. an abstract representation of a member of a group of similar members). An object is a particular programmable entity that shares its defining characteristics (attributes and methods) with the class, i.e. it is a particular member of the category, rather than a general representation of members of that category_.

## Folder = Directory
"Folder" means practically the same thing as "directory". Folder is used in a Windows context while directory in a Linux context.
